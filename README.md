# MATLAB Unexpected Termination Due to 'error' Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to the improper use of the `error` function within a user-defined function. The `error` function is used to halt script execution and display an error message to the user. However, if it is not handled appropriately, this can lead to unexpected termination. 

The `bug.m` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.m` file provides the corrected version of the code with proper error handling.
